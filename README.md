# DiscoWest
A bot that contacts Kanye West, asks him for a quote and a selfie, then messages you back with his response. 

Ever feel like your discord server is missing motivational quotes from 2020's almost-president, Kanye West? Look no further.

Everytime you or someone in your discord mentions "Kanye" in a message, Mr.West is summoned via a set of five images, and hundreds if not thousands of actual kanye quotes provided by api.kanye.rest. 

To change the keyword from "Kanye" to something else - simple type "!set keyword <ENTER NEW KEYWORD HERE>"

To install and run the bot, you need to create a new application via (https://discord.com/developers/applications). Once you have a TOKEN provided to you by discord, you can replace "TOKEN GOES HERE" (check the beginning of DiscoWest.py) with your token. You should be good to go!

Have any questions, contact me on discord! ~ NastyNick#4212
